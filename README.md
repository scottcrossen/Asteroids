# Asteroids

Asteroids for Android.

### Description

I originally built this project to pass off the requirements for a class assignment. It is a classic implementation of Asteroids on Android.

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.

### Instructions

- All code necessary to run on Android Studio or an actual device is included.
- A "Debug" class is included. This allows for the functionality to have a status-print type interface helpful when debugging. It is easily turned off (for when the code is finalized.) by changing the argument in the constructor to Debugger(false) rather than Debugger(true) (which turns it on).
